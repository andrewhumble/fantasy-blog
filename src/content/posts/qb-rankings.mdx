<UpwardTrend name="Jordan Addison"/>

<DownwardTrend name="Deshaun Watson" />
> Deshaun Watson has been struggling with consistency and health issues throughout the season. His recent performances have been marred by turnovers and poor decision-making, leading to a drop in confidence and production for both fantasy owners and the Browns' offense.
